# Daniel Sanchez personal Webpage

This repository contains the code of my personal webpage. It is built using a React app with TypeScript.

The app was initialized using Vite, and SWC for Fast Refresh.

- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc)
- [SWC](https://swc.rs/)

## Start the app locally

For starting the app locally, you'll only need to:

- Install all the required dependencies: `npm i`
- Run the server: `npm run dev`
